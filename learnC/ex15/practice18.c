Your goal is to read a 68-word text from the input and then print it to the screen backwards. 
Individual words do not have to be spelled backwards, but rather your program should print out 
the last word first, then the second-to-last word, etc. No word has more than 40 characters.

Output
"The best programs are written so that computing machines can perform them quickly and so that 
human beings can understand them clearly. A programmer is ideally an essayist who works with 
traditional aesthetic and literary forms as well as mathematical concepts, to communicate the 
way an algorithm works and to convince a reader that the results will be correct." ― Donald Ervin
